Question 1: Ask the user for the total number of papers submitted in a class. Ask the user for the number of students in the class. Output the average number of papers submitted per student. Assume class has more than zero students, and all numbers are integers.
Sample Output:
>>>
How many papers were submitted:  100
How many students are in the class:  20
The average number of papers submitted per student is 5.0

a=int(input("How many papers were submitted: "))
b=int(input("How many students are in the class: "))
print("The average number of papers submitted per student is", a+b/2)

Question 2: Prompt the user for three numbers and then output their
sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder, average.
First number always before second number and second before third for each operation.
Assume the second and third numbers will not be zero.
Sample Output:
>>>
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 25
Enter the third number: 15.6
The sum of 10.0 25.0 15.6 is 50.6
The difference of 10.0 25.0 15.6 is -30.6
The product of 10.0 25.0 15.6 is 3900.0
The quotient of 10.0 25.0 15.6 is 0.025641025641025644
The remainder of 10.0 25.0 15.6 is 10.0
The average of 10.0 25.0 15.6 is 16.866666666666667

Question 3: Ask the user for 3 words/phrases.
Output all possible combinations of the 3 strings.
(first + second + third, third + second + first, etc.)
Sample Output:

>>> 
Enter the first word: hello
Enter the second word: pizza
Enter the third word: world
hello pizza world
hello world pizza
pizza hello world
pizza world hello
world hello pizza
world pizza hello

Question 4: Ask the user for a length and then create functions to provide you
with the appropriate areas for the following shapes:

Write a function that provides the area of a circle with a diameter of length. 

Write a function that provides the area of a triangle
whose length and height are equal to the user provided length.

Write a function that provides the area of a square with sides of the provided length. 


Sample Output:
>>> 
Enter the side/diameter length:  5.2
Area of the Circle is: 21.237166338267002
Area of the Triangle is: 13.520000000000001
Area of the Square is: 27.040000000000003

Question 2: Draw a Triangle using the â€˜*â€™ character. The Triangle should have its length (vertical side) on the left side of the screen and a base of length n, where n is input by the user. Assume n is always an integer.
 
Sample Output:
>>>
Left Facing Triangle's base size:  5
*
